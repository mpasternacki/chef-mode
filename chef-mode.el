;;; Commentary:

;; This library defines a minor mode to work with Opscode Chef
;; (http://www.opscode.com/chef/) repository. It creates two
;; keybindings:

;; - C-c C-c (M-x chef-knife-dwim) - when editing part of chef
;;   repository (cookbook, data bag item, node/role/environment
;;   definition), uploads that part to the Chef Server by calling
;;   appropriate knife command
;; - C-c C-k (M-x knife) - runs a user-specified knife command

;; The library detects bundler and, if Gemfile is present on top-level
;; of the Chef repository, runs 'bundle exec knife' instead of plain
;; 'knife'.

;; If chef-use-rvm is non-nil, it talks with rvm.el
;; (https://github.com/senny/rvm.el) to use proper Ruby and gemset.
